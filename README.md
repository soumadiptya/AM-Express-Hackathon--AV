# Hackathons
A repository for AM Express Data and Codes. This was a predictive analytics problem, where given a users demographic and historical click patterns we were asked to predict whether they would click on a given add or not. Data sources available were:-
* Train.csv- This file contained mostly demographic information of each user such as gender, age level, city etc. along with certain product details and whether they clicked on the add or not. ***Target column of interest was is_click***
* Test.csv- Same as train with the Target feature absent
* Historical user logs.csv- Contained historical browsing patterns for users along with product id's and whether they viewed, expressed interest or did neither for the product
